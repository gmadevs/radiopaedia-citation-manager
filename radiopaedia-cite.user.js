/*
 * How this hangs together
 * -----------------------
 * Citing a paper on Radiopaedia is two things that live at opposite ends of
 * the edit page and have to agree with each other: a `<sup>` marker in the
 * prose, and a numbered line in the reference list at the bottom. The number
 * is the only thing joining them. Nothing on the page checks that it is the
 * right one, and by the twentieth reference nobody remembers which paper is
 * eleven — so the marker gets typed from memory, or by scrolling down, losing
 * the caret, scrolling back up and hoping.
 *
 * This is the other way round: the caret stays where it is, and the list comes
 * to it. One button in the editor's own toolbar, beside H3; one panel; you
 * type; you press return.
 *
 * Three things can be asked of it, and they are the three things a person
 * actually wants:
 *
 *   - cite one of the references already down there. Type any word of it —
 *     author, journal, year, the number itself — and the list narrows the way
 *     Zotero's does. Return puts the marker in.
 *   - cite the last one you added, which is the commonest of all: you have
 *     just written a paragraph out of the paper you added a minute ago. It is
 *     the row the panel opens on, so that press is open-and-return and nothing
 *     else.
 *   - cite a paper that is NOT down there yet. Paste anything the citation
 *     tool can resolve — a DOI, a PMID, a PMCID, a PII, an ISBN, a Google
 *     Books volume id, or a URL to the paper, to a Wikipedia page, to any
 *     website — and it is looked up on radiopaedia.work/cite, shown to you in
 *     full, and on your say-so added as the next numbered reference AND cited
 *     in the text, in one press.
 *
 *     Which of those it is decides where the offer stands in the list, and
 *     that is not a cosmetic decision: an identifier is unambiguous, so it
 *     goes first and return looks it up. Words are not — "ependymoma" is
 *     overwhelmingly "cite the ependymoma paper I already have" — so a plain
 *     search goes last, under the references it might have meant.
 *
 * Where the number goes, and in what shape
 * ----------------------------------------
 * A marker is `<sup>1</sup>` with a space in front of it — `haemangioblastoma)
 * <sup>1</sup>.` — and it sits INSIDE the sentence, before the full stop. Both
 * of those are house style and both are easy to get wrong by hand, so neither
 * is left to the hand: the space is added when the character before is not one
 * already, and a caret parked immediately after a sentence's full stop hops
 * back over it rather than dropping the marker outside the sentence.
 *
 * When the caret is already beside a marker, the number joins it instead of
 * standing a second `<sup>` next to the first: `<sup>2</sup>` and 3 becomes
 * `<sup>2,3</sup>`, and three or more in a row close up into a range —
 * `<sup>2-4</sup>`. Written back out from the numbers, so the list also comes
 * back sorted and deduplicated, which is the other thing hand-typed markers
 * get wrong.
 *
 * What it writes, and what it does not
 * ------------------------------------
 * The marker is asked for the way a person would ask for it — the editor's own
 * insert where there is one, otherwise the number typed and then ⌘. (ctrl-.
 * away from a Mac) pressed on it. Not for tidiness: an editor that keeps its
 * own model of the document renders the page from that model, and a `<sup>`
 * that never went through it is gone at the next render, leaving the number in
 * the running text at full size. Typing survives; markup written behind the
 * editor's back does not. `raiseHere` has the order and the reasons.
 *
 * Two places, both of them yours to undo: the `<sup>` in the editor, and a new
 * box in the reference list with `N. …` in it. Nothing is saved — the form is
 * still sitting there unsubmitted, and every marker can be selected and
 * deleted like any other text. The fetched citation also goes to the clipboard
 * on its way past, so a lookup is never lost even if the box could not be
 * created.
 *
 * The reference itself is never rewritten. If what is already down there
 * differs from what the databases say, that is a job for the citation linter
 * (radiopaedia-lint's `Lint citation` chip) and not for a tool whose business
 * is the number.
 *
 * What it costs
 * -------------
 * One request, to radiopaedia.work/cite, per lookup you confirm — and a lookup
 * only ever happens because you typed an identifier and pressed return.
 * Reading the references costs nothing: they are in the form. The answer is
 * kept for the tab, so pasting the same PMID twice asks once.

   * standing BEFORE that text, and take the biggest such row — that is the

   * H3 is there to be found (by its text, or by the label a screen reader
   * would read out), beside H2 or H1 if it is not, and at the end of the row
   * if none of them can be recognised. The end of the row is where the
